## NESTJS (nest/\*)

#### Docker

Dockerfiles in the `apss/<app>`. Build from root with `-f` (like in CI builds).

#### ENV

All the envs are in the `.`. When adding new, make your example/test.

#### Buidling with nest

Using nest commands take care of most stuff. But check the webpack, nest-cli (libs build with webpac) and other files around (tsconfig/packag).

### APPS
